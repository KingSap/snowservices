= Gravity Ringer =

This is a program which silences your phone based on the pitch the phone makes. For example: I want my phone to be silenced when I put it upside down in my pants. I'll automagically go from audibly ringing to vibrate only when it's upside down for a couple of secs. The angles and delay can be set.
