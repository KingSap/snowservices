= SnowGestures =

This class makes it easier for developers to implement simple gestures. The class recognizes 4 different directions: Up, 
Down, Left and Right.

== How to implement ==

 First, ofcourse, initialise an instance of SnowGesture. Then you have two options:
 * Use a Â´SnowGesture.GestureListener` to register a gesture and it accompanying listener.
 * Use a 'SnowGesture.GestureCompleteListener' to implement the recognition yourself.

== Gesture string ==

A gesture string consists of characters which indicate a direction: U for up, D for down, R for right and L for left. The gesture string should be in upper case, but the registerGesture converts it to upper case in case you didn't already.
An example:
{{{
String gestureString = "LRU";
}}}
Means first go Left then Right and then Up.
